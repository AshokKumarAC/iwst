                      <p>The use of timber in the boat-building or shipbuilding industry is as old as the construction
                        of boats and ships. Various kinds of timber are used in different regions of India in the
                        construction of vessels. The Yuktikalpataru (the wishing tree of artifice) composed by the king
                        Bhoja of Dhar (11th century AD) gives a detailed account of boats, ships and the variety of wood
                        used for construction and classification of ships. Further, the text also mentions the quality
                        of timber that is required for construction of seagoing ships, which could resist the action of
                        waves, currents and marine biofouling; above all, it would bring joy and wealth. In order to
                        locate the remains of ships, cargo and their history, maritime archaeological explorations were
                        carried out off Goa, which brought to light timber from the century old shipwreck off St
                        George's Reef and an iron anchor with a wooden stock 300 years old from Aguada waters.
                        Radiocarbon dating and anatomical analysis of these two timbers were obtained to understand
                        their age and to know the tree species. This communication details the anatomical analysis of
                        timber and associated findings from the sites. Their tentative dates are ascribed to the
                        findings in relation to the maritime history of the Goa region along the central west coast of
                        India. Additionally, the study put forth the view that Indian teak was extensively used by
                        Indian and foreign shipbuilders because of its high quality.
                        Dielectric properties at microwave frequency (9.55 GHz) of seven plantation timbers in
                        longitudinal and transverse (radial/tangential) directions in oven dry condition were determined
                        along with anatomical properties (fibre length, fibre diameter, wall thickness, fibre lumen
                        diameter, vessel diameter, vessel element length, percentage of fibers and fibre wall material
                        per unit area). It was observed that dielectric constant of wood increases with increasing
                        specific gravity and the values of dielectric constant and loss tangent are higher in
                        longitudinal than transverse (radial/tangential) directions. It has also been observed that
                        dielectric properties of timber decrease with increasing fibre lumen diameter. There was no
                        specific type of relationship between dielectric and other measured anatomical properties.</p>

                        by ITC Bhadrachalam are reported. The five clones represented by four trees each, of 4-5 year
                        old were from Sarpaka demonstration plot, Andhra Pradesh, India. Intra-clonal variation was
                        significant in basic density, vessel diameter, vessel element length, fibre length, fibre
                        diameter, fibre wall thickness, while variation in tissue proportions were non significant.
                        However, inter-clonal variation was significant for all the parameters. Basic density was
                        positively correlated with vessel diameter and percentage of rays, while girth has a negative
                        influence on fibre diameter and fibre wall thickness. Fibre length, fibre diameter and fibre
                        lumen diameter were positively inter-correlated, while negative correlations were observed among
                        the tissue proportions. Vessel diameter was also correlated positively with ray percentage and
                        negatively with vessel percentage. All these correlations are suggestive of spatial adjustments

                      <p>The demand of timber in India for different industrial as well as domestic applications is ever
                        increasing mostly due to urbanization and industrialization. This demand can only be met either
                        from the imported timber or from the plantation resources outside the reserved and natural
                        forests. There are a number of timber species grown under plantation forestry having their
                        heartwood refractory to any chemical treatment or very difficult to treat but naturally durable.
                        Heartwood of such timbers need no preservative treatment. Although species like Acacia
                        crassicarpa, Cupressus goveniana, Cupressus lusitanica, Enterolobium contortisiliquum,
                        Gironniera reticulata, Mastixia arborea and Sterculia urens are found to have a number of
                        applications but they can not be recommended at present for different uses, either in contact
                        with ground or high humidity conditions, due to non availability of information on their
                        durability and their amenability to preservative treatment. The general features and internal
                        anatomical structure of woods of these species suggest that preservative treatment is possible
                        for value addition leading to large-scale applications. For this, improved processing
                        technologies are to be developed and proper market supports are essential. The success story of
                        utilization potential of rubber wood in India based on R & D efforts is a case worth mentioning
                        and some of the durable timbers can also be used for different purposes identified. Acacia
                        auriculaeformis is found to be suitable for furniture and if proper seasoning and preservative
                        treatments are followed, this species has tremendous scope in furniture industry. This will lead
                        to an acceptable level of these species by the consumers and also lessen the burden on the
                        primary timbers. </p><br />

                      <p>The photostabilization of wood surfaces is desirable to enhance the life of wood under exterior
                        use and to improve the performance of clear coatings wood surfaces. Chemical modification of
                        wood has been found effective in upgrading properties such as biological durability and
                        dimensional stability and has been suggested as a potential way for inducing photostability on

                        accelerated weathering conditions. Wood specimens of Pinus roxburghii (Chir pine) were
                        esterified with benzoyl chloride to 19.5 wt % gain and exposed to a xenon arc light source in a
                        Weather-O-Meter for different periods ranging from 0 to 500 h. The irradiated samples were
                        analyzed for color changes and chemical changes. The analysis of color changes in wood surfaces
                        by ultraviolet- visible irradiation was carried out with a color measuring (CIELAB) system, and
                        chemical changes were characterized with fluorescence and fourier transform infrared
                        spectroscopy. The esterification of wood by benzoyl chloride suppressed the color changes
                        (photodiscoloration) due to irradiation. Modification also reduced the lignin degradation and
                        generation of carbonyl groups on the surface of the irradiated wood. The fluorescence emission
                        spectra of irradiated unmodified wood showed a large reduction in intensity and a large redshift
                        in the emission maximum, whereas modified wood showed only a small change in fluorescence
                        intensity on irradiation. The results show that the esterification of wood with benzoyl chloride
                        was effective for the photostabilization of the wood polymers</p>

                      <p>Wood is versatile and widely used structural engineering material for indoor and outdoor
                        applications. In exterior use, it is subjected to varying environmental conditions resulting in
                        physical deterioration, discolouration, surface roughening, cracking and damage of the
                        microstructure. Weathering affects physical and mechanical properties of wood and also results
                        in premature coating failure. In this paper, results of deterioration of wood surfaces of rubber
                        wood (Hevea brasiliensis) under natural and accelerated weathering conditions are presented.
                        Effects of weathering on physical and chemical deterioration of wood surfaces are discussed.
                        FTIR spectroscopic studies of weathered wood surfaces show a rapid delignification and

                        blocks and compared with the corresponding transmission spectra measured from thin wood section.
                        Studies indicated that high quality spectra could be obtained from either solid wood blocks or
                        powder by diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) and photoacoustic (PAS) techniques. Positions of IR bands
                        measured from different hard wood species by DRIFT and PAS technique are approximately same.
                        However, the relative intensities of IR bands vary among species. For obtaining reproducible

                        results in best resolved spectrum. Specular reflection causes distortions in the intensities of
                        the bands in the range 1150 - 950 cm-1, which can be minimised either by diluting sample powder

                        supports of other materials. Timber is easily available, more easily processed than other

                        underground mines after 8 years of exposure. Eucalyptus and Casuarina poles treated with CCA,
                        CCB and ACC along with controls were nstalled at different depths under varied water seepage and
                        humidity conditions at Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. Kolar Gold filed in May 1985. Observations were
                        made annually to evaluate the service conditions of timber. Results after 8 years of exposure
                        indicated that untreated lagging poles were destroyed within 3-5 years except at location where
                        no direct water seepage occurred. The untreated poles, at this location have continued to be
                        serviceable with moderate decay. Preservative treated poles have remained serviceable largely
                        with moderate decay under varied conditions. Warm and humid air associated with water seepage
                        appeared to be major factors for rapid decay of timber in mines</p>

                      <p>The permeability of wood is an important factor in wood processing because it is indicative of
                        the ease with which fluids can be transported into or out of wood. The superficial gas
                        permeability of plantation grown 14 year old Acacia nilotica was measured in this study. The
                        results were compared to determine if significant differences existed among different steaming
                        periods. Results were also compared whether any difference existed among inner heartwood, middle
                        heartwood and outer heartwood zones. Overall, the superficial gas permeability was not affected
                        by pretreatment techniques when compared to control samples, although the increase in
                        permeability was observed with increased steaming period. On the other hand, statistical
                        significance was established among flow directions, wherein, axial flow was far greater than
                        transverse flow. Radial permeability was found slightly higher than tangential permeability.</p>

                        amounts of energy during mechanical pulping and will produce pulps with different strengths.
                        2247 Pinus radiata logs of varying age and length, SED, LED, taper, and volume were measured for
                        acoustic velocity, segregated into four different velocity groups and chipped separately. Each

                        perform very differently in terms of pulp properties when refined to a given freeness or at a
                        certain energy input. At a given target freeness there was a 20% difference in energy
                        requirement between the lowest and highest velocity logs. Similarly there was a 17% difference
                        in tensile strength between the lowest and highest velocity logs for a given specific energy.

                        <p>Deterioration of timber by biological agencies under marine conditions is a highly complex problem
                          affecting diverse maritime operations. In India, the additional expenditure incurred by the fishing
                          industry alone for providing remedial measures against wood infesting organisms is a staggering
                          figure of over 400 million rupees. Of the different techniques employed to control biodeterioration,
                          impregnation of wood by preservatives that contain biocidal chemicals is the most widely accepted
                          method. In this method, the toxicants are gradually released by the leaching action of sea water to
                          provide control. Inorganic compounds of heavy metals (copper, arsenic, zinc, etc.) have been the
                          principal biocides used extensively in the 'wood preservatives' for many years. More recently, the
                          trend has been to use organo-metallic compounds (TBTO, etc.). These chemicals, although very
                          effective, are potentially important sources of contamination. In the current context of growing
                          concern for maintenance of purity of aquatic systems, environmental compatibility is bound to play
                          an increasingly restrictive role in the usage of wood preservatives especially in areas of high
                          boating activity (ports, near shore environs, etc.) and in specialised situations like
                          marine/brackish water fish-farms and sites near coastal industrial establishments. In this paper,
                          the possibilities for evolving non-polluting, environmentally acceptable protectants are examined in
                          detail. Emphasis is laid on control of the biological 'weak links' in the life cycles of the
                          destructive organisms and usage of natural anti-biodeterioration compounds, occurring either in bio
                          resistant woods or in marine organisms</p>

                        <p>Creosote or coal tar creosote is most successfully and commonly used preservative with certain
                          disadvantages like obnoxious odour, unpleasant colour and unpaintability. Creosote oil was steam
                          distilled to get clean and less odorous steam volatile products (SVC). The yield was 30% and
                          chemical composition was identified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Acridine,
                          2-methyl naphthalene, acenaphthene and O-xylene were among the chemical constituents identified in
                          the steam volatile creosote. The efficacy of this steam volatile oil was investigated against wood
                          rotters, mould and stain fungi and termites and this SVC was found to be effective as natural
                          creosote but with added advantages like improved colour and lessened obnoxious odour. These improved
                          features of SVC may be attributed to the higher percentage of 2 methyl naphthalene (9.46).
                          acenaphathene (39.48) and O-xylene (3.73) compare to the same constituents of natural creosote
                          6,23,9 and 2.9 respectively. An barring water in the form of steam. Therefore the method of
                          obtaining SVC is economical and equally effective as natural creosote with the advantages of
                          improved colour, odour and clarity.</p>

                        <p>Knowledge on the amount of preservatives leaching out of treated wood is essential to optimise the
                          chemical loading in various species of timber required for different end uses. In order to gain more
                          insight into this aspect, the residual CCA content in 40 treated timber panels belonging to 14
                          species removed on destruction by marine organisms from a series of durability tests conducted in
                          Kochi waters (west coast, India) were estimated. The data showed that CCA enhanced the durability of
                          various timber species to different degrees. In the case of panels treated to lower loading, the
                          average annual leaching of CCA ranged from 0.36-2.81 kg.m-3 and that in specimens subjected to
                          higher loading from 0.54-4.99 kg.m-3. The leaching rate was found to be relatively slower in panels
                          with higher loading than that with lower loading. In general, the leaching rate of CCA was seen
                          varying among panels of different species, panels with identical initial preservative content and
                          even among various panels within a species. The study thus suggests the requirement of in-depth

                          catamarans made of CCA treated logs of Bombax ceiba put to continuous service for the last 15 years
                          at the Lawson's Bay fishing village, Visakhapatnam. The samples were dried to constant weight,
                          powdered, digested and analyzed for the residual salts of the preservative. The residual content of
                          CCA was found to be 6.90, 6.24 and 7.43 kg/m3 in CAT I, II and III, respectively. The values for
                          individual components of arsenic, copper and chrome were 0.24 to 0.34 kg/m3, 3.34 to 4.37 kg/m3 and
                          2.66 to 3.03 kg/m3, respectively. Making use of the initial absorptions of the preservative
                          determined at the time of treatment and the residual contents estimated now, the leaching rates of
                          CCA and its components were calculated. While the annual leaching rate of CCA was observed to be
                          1.22 kg/m3 (CAT I), 0.81 kg/m3 (CAT II) and 0.83 kg/m3 (CAT III), at elemental level, it was found
                          to be 0.05, 0.04 and 0.05 kg/m3 in the case of arsenic, 0.15, 0.10 and 0.09 kg/m3 in the case of
                          copper and 0.20, 0.12 and 0.14 kg/m3 in the case of chromium for CAT I, II and III, respectively.
                          The results thus indicate that while about 2/3rd the initial amount of CCA had been leached out of
                          the catamarans during the last 15 years, still 1/3rd the amount is present in the logs. Thus, the
                          preservative left out in the catamarans appears to be sufficient to offer protection to the craft

                        <p>Due to shortage of timber coupled with other compelling factors, traditional fishermen along the
                          east coast of India, especially of Andhra Pradesh, of late, are departing from conventional log type
                          wooden catamarans. Instead, they are fabricating catamarans out of timber planks of hard woods and
                          utilizing thermocol for buoyancy. Mostly, locally available timber of a Combretaceae species,
                          Anogeissus acuminata (Yon) is used to fabricate these plank-built catamarans. Since these catamarans
                          are also built with untreated timber, there is every need to extend wood preservation technology to
                          these craft also so as to achieve enhanced service life and conserve the resources. Therefore, the
                          nstitute of Wood Science and Technology took up treatment of timber meant for five such craft with
                          copper-chrome-arsenic (CCA). Thirteen different logs were procured and converted into planks and
                          batons of suitable sizes, debarked, cleaned and air-dried under shade. While the length of the
                          planks ranged from 0.81 to 6.53 m, the width varied from 16 to 44 cm. After sufficient seasoning,
                          the material was pressure treated with 6% CCA by full cell method as per IS: 401 (1982). Chemical
                          retentions were computed from the weight gained by the individual planks and sets of 20 batons
                          immediately after treatment. The preservative absorption in the planks ranged from 13.05 to 69.80
                          kg/m3 averaging at 25.90 kg/m3 and that in the batons averaged at 32 kg/m3. The quantity of CCA
                          absorbed by the planks was analyzed with reference to their ength, width, thickness and volume.
                          Planks when categorized to different length and volume groups exhibited clear difference in the
                          intake of chemical by them but when categorized into different width and thickness classes showed
                          not much variation. All the treated planks and batons after air-drying in shade for 15 days were
                          fabricated into five catamarans. Thus, though the planks of A. acuminata are either very long or
                          very wide, they showed a positive response to CCA treatment by absorbing reasonably good quantities
                          of preservative. Similarly, on fabrication of the catamarans, an average retention of 21.79 to 25.43
                          kg/m3 of CCA per craft could be achieved. These values fall into the recommended preservative
                          absorption range of 16 to 32 kg/m3 (IS: 401, 1982) for marine structures</p>

                          the moisture content is very high. It is estimated that an average loss of 1-40% of the imported as
                          well as locally procured raw material occurs due to biodeterioration. The feasibility of
                          preservative treatment of green rattans by dipping and pressure processes with water borne
                          preservative. Copper Chrome Boron (CCB) composition was studied. The study indicated that the dry
                          salt Retention (DSR) value obtained for 48 hrs. dipping period is adequate and may be used as a
                          prophylactic treatment as soon as the rattans are harvested at the felling site itself. In pressure
                          process, the DSR value recommended by the Indian Standard specification for canes used for non
                          structural purposes is 8 kg/m3 This could easily be achieved by rating rattans in green condition
                          with a low concentration (3%) of CCB preservative, with a treatment schedule of 15 minutes- initial
                          vacuum of 56 cm of Hg for 5 minutes. This treatment schedule saves much time and energy. Pressure
                          treatment of rattans in green conditions avoids the requirement of prophylactic treatment
                          immediately after harvest and also prevents from any fungal attack during drying material.</p>

                          The grafting was carried out in a Brabender Plasticoder at 1800C. The effect of monomer and
                          initiator concentrations on the yield of grafting were investigated by performing statistical
                          analysis. While the grafting yield increased with the concentration of DCP at any given
                          concentration of m-TMI, the variation of the grafting yield with m-TMI concentration, for a given

                          wt.% concentration of both DCP and m-TMI. The grafting reaction is accompanied by considerable chain
                          scission of i-PP, resulting in a decrease in the molecular weight of the grafted polymer. While the

                        <p>Growth stress is a common phenomenon found in each stem and in each branch of trees. They have
                          their origin in growing wood cells. Which tend to contract in fibre direction and to expand
                          transerversely against restraining forces of adjoining older wood cells. Presence of high magnitude
                          of growth stress in plantation-grown timber causes significant problems in the conversion of felled
                          trees to lumber. The loss due to these problems can be minimized if a prior information on the
                          pattern and magnitude of growth stress present in trees or logs is available. For this a rapid
                          simple, inexpensive and non-destructive method of measurement of growth stresses is required. The
                          techniques available for measurement of growth stress, though, can provide accurate value for growth

                        <p>The relationships between longitudinal growth strain and wood properties of Eucalyptus nitens were
                          investigated. Sixty-three 10- y-old trees were selected for this study. Longitudinal growth strain,
                          green density, green moisture content, basic density, radial shrinkage, outer-wood and core-wood
                          densities, volumetric shrinkage and dynamic modulus of elasticity (MoE) at 12% moisture content and
                          length-weighted fibre length were determined. Amongst all the studied wood properties, only
                          shrinkage-related properties were found to have some association with the mean growth strain in
                          trees. The mean growth strain was moderately but significantly related to the volumetric shrinkage
                          of the outer-wood, but not to the shrinkage of the core-wood. However, the volumetric shrinkage
                          differential (difference between outer-wood and core-wood shrinkage ) was strongly related to the
                          growth strain (r = 0.70), suggesting that the growth stress gradient might be related to variations
                          in shrinkage properties within the stem. The wood of trees with the lowest growth strains had
                          statistically significantly lower volumetric shrinkage, lower outer-wood MoE and less collapse than
                          wood of trees with the highest growth strains. The results suggest that E. nitens trees with low
                          strains could exhibit a lower degree of drying defects such as collapse and checking during
                          processing.</p>

                          were performed on water repellent coated and untreated wood. Water repellency was very high in the
                          first cycle and then declined in all the coating system in subsequent cycles. After 10th cycle WRE
                          became constant for all the systems. PMDI exhibited highest water repellency followed by chromium

                          is found to exist between enthalpy and entropy for adsorption of water in wood. The phenomenon can
                          be related to the swelling of wood. A different viewpoint of phenomenon of enthalpy-entropy
                          compensation is given which is in accordance with Le Chateliers principle. Hence enthalpy entropy
                          compensation can be regarded as a manifestation of Le Chateller's principle, which is due to
                          conservation of energy.</p>

                    a complex phenomenon, which involves different organisms, which makes diverse contributions to the
                    process. Mangifera indica stakes were exposed in test yard. Microorganisms were isolated; colonies
                    were counted periodically from stakes. It is observed that bacteria invade wood as primarily
                    colonizers and multiply very fast up to 15 days, followed by molds like Mucor and Rhizopus, and
                    different species of Aspergillus and Pencillium after 16 days of ground contact. Stainers colonise
                    the wood more or less on the same period as primary molds appear. The appearance and developmental

                    Mycorrhizae (VAM fungi) to Acacia auriculiformis has shown increased growth potential and many
                    stabilize soil for vegetation succession. VAM inoculum helps the tree to survive better and has
                    definite potential for achieving better growth of plants in mine dump soil.</p>

                    of wood components had not been investigated. Using dry weight analyses of tunnel walls and frass
                    produced, P.spadix adults consumed scots pine with soft rot decay at a rate of 1.59 � 0.37 mgd-1 and
                    the digestibility of this substrate was 57.96 � 0.37 mg d-1 and the digestibility of this substrate
                    was 57.96 � 5.89 (i.e, for 100 mg consumed SR-pine, 58 mg was digested). Using gravimetric analysis
                    to quantify structural wood components in tunnel walls and frass, p. spadix adults were found to

                    larvae digesting cellulose and lignin more efficiently than adults. When FTIR was employed to
                    analyze adult tunnel walls and frass from undecayed pine, cellulose and hemicellulose were digested,
                    but no evidence of lignin digestion was found. This study shows that adults digest lignin when soft

                    lignin and carbohydrates as a result of decay were determined after different exposure periods. In
                    wood decayed by C. puteana there was a progressive increase in lignin content relative to
                    carbohydrate evident from increases in the relative height of lignin associated bands (at 1596,

                    At higher weight losses, spectra for wood decayed by C. puteana have many similarities with that of
                    Klason lignin isolated from wood. In contrast, wood decayed by P. chrysosporium showed selective
                    type decay with a reduction in peak heights associated with lignin relative to carbohydrates.
                    Although weight losses in samples exposed to C. versicolor were high (45.5 % and 39.8 % for beech
                    and Scots pine respectively after 12 weeks) simultaneous decay resulted in little change in the
                    relative intensities of the lignin and carbohydrate bands, with only a slight preference for lignin.

                    Aleurocanthus lobulatus Juesudasan and David, (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) were recorded. The former was
                    observed infesting the leaves of Kandelia candel (L.) Druce and the latter two, infesting the leaves
                    of Rhizophora mucronata Poir. Both the plants are true mangrove species, belonging to the tribe
                    Rhizpphoraeae.This is the first report on white flies from Eumangroves. Kandelia candel (L). Druce
                    is a new host record for Aleurodicus disperses.The population of white fly adults occurring in a
                    mangrove patch in Kundapur, Karnataka was monitored for six months. The population showed a
                    fluctuating trend with peak in the month of September.</p>

                  <p>Management of the teak defoliators, Eutectona machareralis Walker and Hyblaea puera Cramer have
                    always been a matter of grave concern to teak growers because the attack by these pests adversely
                    affects the growth and biomass of the trees.Though many efforts have been made to manage these pests
                    through chemical and biological means, yet due to the complicated life history and behaviour of the
                    pests, the population is not often contained to the desired extent. The population dynamics of the
                    pests, in the ecological conditions of Karnataka was studied for 5 years. The population build up
                    was observed in 2 spells during a year. One milder during April to May and the other severe during
                    September to December. The phenomenon of hibernation of E. mahaeralis was also observed during the
                    winter months. Since teak is a deciduous tree, all the infested leaves with pupae fall to the ground
                    and the adults emerge at different times leading to the slow population built up, it is recommended
                    that the fallen leaves along with the non-hibernating /hibernating larvae can be easily collected by
                    sweeping the tree bottom and destroyed by burning. The collection and burning of leaves, in addition
                    to yielding ash for use as fertilizer, shall also help in reducing the pest population to a great
                    extent. Based on the experimental findings and on the available information, an IPM strategy
                    including biological, chemical and cultural control is suggested for the management of teak

                    and termites. It was observed that 10-50 percent (average 25%) of sandal timber in the depots had
                    hollowed heartwood. An average of 198.6 kg of heartwood is lost for every tonne of wood produced by
                    sandal trees</p>

                    wood destroying termites of the oriental and ethiopean regions. The seasonal activity of termites
                    was studied by installation of untreated timber panels in the test yard. Of the ten species of
                    Odontotermes identified O. horni (Washmann), O. anamallensis Holmgren & Holmgren and O. redemanni

                    somewhat inverse and no relation between the incidence of termites and atmospheric humidity is
                    apparent. It can be presumed for the present that the effect of rain in loosening the dry and hard

                  <p>Handicrafts is considered an ancient cottage industry, representing the rich heritage of India and
                    earning a very high foreign exchange. Packing case industry utilizes a lion share of the timber
                    produced in our country. Surveys were conducted in many factories, godowns and showrooms of
                    handicraft and packing industries in Chennapatna, Mysore and Bangalore districts of Karnataka state,
                    to identify the wood borer pest damage and to assess the loss encountered in the above industries.
                    Information were recorded in a formatted questionnaire and the damaged timber along with different
                    stages of the beetle were collected for study. It was observed that other than the 17 conventional
                    timbers, 8 other alternate timber species are being used in these industries. The three major beetle
                    pests are Lyctus africantus, Sinaxylon species and Heterobostrychus aequalis. A loss of upto 25% is
                    estimated due to insect pest damage to the timber from the raw wood to the finished product stage.
                    This loss could be attributed to the use of sapwood on conventional timbers and the use of alternate
                    and short rotation plantation timbers utilized in the handicraft and packing case industries.</p>

                  <p>The demand, ban on timber felling, escalating cost and poor supply of conventional timbers has
                    forced the consumer to utilize secondary timbers, plantation timbers and exotic timbers. Secondary
                    and exotic timbers are presently being used on a large scale for varied purposes like building,
                    furniture making, handicraft products, packing cases., etc., knowledge on the natural durability of

                    grave yard. The duration of study was for a period of 36 months and four timber species Tectona
                    grandis, Shorea sp., Artocarpus heterophyllus, Pterocarpus dalbergiodes were found to be highly

                    pests without causing any adverse effect on the environment. Among the plants, Neem (Azadirachta
                    indica) is the single most important source of pesticides and its potential against several
                    agricultural and horticultural crop pests have been well documented. Only few reports on the
                    potential of neem for the management of tree pests are available. In this paper, an attempt is made
                    to review the effects of neem products on the insect pests of forestry importance. Techniques based
                    on pheromones are viable alternatives for pest management in agriculture and forestry. A review on
                    these lines indicates that many countries have history of success in using pheromones in the

                  <p>Acacia auriculaeformis and A. mangium are among the important exotic species of acacia, which are
                    introduced to India from Australia. These species have proved very successful in afforestation and
                    reclamation of waste lands due to their adaption to new habitats and rapid growth potential. They
                    are planted as shelter plants, soil improver and ornamented plants. Besides, these are economically
                    important trees as source of tannin, gum, pulp and timber. The plantation of A. auriculaeformis, A.
                    mangium and their hybrid variety are being raised as plantation mainly as source of pulp for the
                    paper mills. As more and more plantations of these species are coming up, wood is also used as
                    timber for furniture, tools, agricultural implements, turnery articles, toys, construction material
                    etc. The natural resistance of timber from 15 year old plantation of A. auriculaeformis, A. mangium
                    and their hybrid received from Mysore Paper mills, Bhadravathi was tested for their durability
                    against wood rotting fungi as per IS 4873-1968 under laboratory conditions. All the three acacias
                    showed high resistance against all the test fungi and the timber can be grouped under class-I.</p>

                  <p>Rubberwood samples were chemically modified using a two step reaction. The wood was esterified with
                    two different dicarboxylic acid anhydrides, namely, maleic anhydride and phathalic anhydride and
                    subsequently treated with epichlorophydrin to obtain oligoesterified wood. The treated wooden blocks
                    were assessed for bio-resistance against white and brown rot fungi. Malefic anhydride alone treated
                    samples showed resistance only for the brown rot attack but failed to protect against the white rot
                    fungi. Except for the malefic anhydride treatment, other treatments showed a weight loss of less

                    best effect was shown in the combination of phtalic anhydride and epichlorohydrin. This technique
                    was found to be promising as an environmental friendly method to protect rubberwood against decay

                    manufactured wooden article that contains sapwood. Presently, in India many short rotation and
                    alternate timbers are being used for making many finished products. The inclusion of sapwood
                    containing starch makes these products very susceptible to insect borer attack. Consequently, many

                    reported the occurrence of this genus in India by describing P. sairandhryensis. The present study
                    revealed the occurrence of P. myricae in Western ghats of southern India on Wendlandia thrysolidea
                    (Rutaceae). The details of this species and a key to the Indian species of Parabemisia are presented

                        <p>A historical review of literature on depredation of marine borers on wooden ships and on protective
                          methods adapted from antiquity to modern times is presented. Recorded history of early voyages are
                          replete with accounts of ravages of marine borers on wooden ships, riddling their bottom planks to
                          the extent of causing ship wrecks. Even survival of sunken ships as wrecks depends on the mercy of
                          wood-destroying agencies, which may turn these 'port-hole' of history into meaningless junks. The
                          silent saboteurs involved in several early shipwrecks are the molluscan and crustacean borers, aided
                          by bacteria and fungi. An impressive array of combative arsenal was employed by man to prevent
                          biodeterioration of wood. These include deep-charring, coating with pitch, coal tar, whale oil and
                          mustard oil with lime; scupper nailing ('filling'); sheathing with animal skin, hair, tarred paper,
                          wooden boards (unprotected or soaked in coal tar, Ferrous sulphate, Copper sulphate or Lead
                          monoxide), lead and copper sheets, neoprene-coated plywoods; painting with Copper oxide,
                          Pentachlorophenol or Phenyl-arsenious oxide; cement-concrete and plastic casings and
                          pressure-impregnation with wood preservatives (creosote, coal tar and fuel oil mixtures and
                          copper-chrome-arsenic). None of these imparts complete protection. Marine archaeological
                          investigations at known shipwreck sites should be, therefore, augmented to unearth invaluable
                          historical data before they are lost to satisfy the insatiable appetite of the animal saboteurs of
                          the sea.</p>

                          (1:1) at two levels of absorption. At the end of five years, the resistance in untreated controls in
                          decreasing order of attack by Teredo and Martesia striata was A. latifolia, L. microcarpa and T.
                          alata. In decreasing order of resistance, Mimusops sp., C. velutina, A. fraxinifolius and B. ceiba
                          lasted only 12-18 months. In the durable timber, CCA treatment at higher absorptions considerably
                          improved durability. Treatment with CFO (1:1), both in lower and higher absorptions greatly enhanced
                          the durability of the durable timber. A considerable increase of durability in non-durable timber
                          was also observed. The performance of non-durable timber was found to be equivalent to that of the
                          naturally durable timber by treatment at higher absorptions of CFO (1:1). Results indicating the
                          timber showing better natural resistance and preservatives recording better performance with
                          reference to availability and uses of the tested timber are discussed.</p>

                        <p>Entoprocta remains one of the poorly investigated marine invertebrate groups encountered in the
                          fouling communities. There have been no reports of "fouling" entoprocts from the Indian region and,
                          in general, there is an extreme paucity of information on the Indian species even from other
                          situations. The latest comprehensive work on the group from India is approximately 70 years old. Its
                          systematics is in a chaotic state and huge gaps exist in the knowledge of its ecology and biology.
                          During the course of an investigation on marine biofouling at Visakhapatnam, it was noticed that
                          entoprocts are an important component - especially in the early stages of development - of test
                          block communities. As many as five species belonging to the families Pedicellinidae and Urnatellidae
                          - Pedicellina cernua (Pallas), Barentsia gracilis (M. Sars), B. discreta (Busk), B. ramosa
                          (Robertson), Loxosomatoides laevis (Annandale) - were found in the present study. Of these, B.
                          ramosa is a new record for the Indian Ocean region and B. gracilis is reported for the first time
                          from Indian waters. P. cernua is a new record for the Bay of Bengal. All these species are new
                          locality records for Visakhapatnam. Brief descriptions of the species encountered employing modern
                          terminology, measurements of taxonomically important meristic characters and notes on their
                          distribution are provided and the species illustrated. Data on seasonal occurrence, abundance and
                          growth rates for important species are given and their role in fouling discussed. The study
                          indicates that these organisms are probably more common in fouling communities than was generally
                          thought in the past - a view that is increasingly gaining support in recent years. </p>

                        <p>Mytilopsis sallei (Recluz) is an exotic bivalve, introduced to Indian waters in the late 1960's,
                          presumably through ship fouling. Since then, the species has met with an astounding success, gaining
                          monospecific dominance in fouling communities in certain localities as at Visakhapatnam harbour. The
                          bivalve grows fast, is highly fecund, tolerates a wide range of environmental conditions and is
                          capable of enormous build up of fouling biomass even upto 100 kg/m3/year. It is, therefore, a major
                          fouling pest and its incidence in any harbour is increasingly being viewed with grave concern. In
                          this paper, the success and spread of this species in Indian harbours is briefly outlined.</p>

                        <p>Wood from Hevea brasiliensis (Wild. ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell. Arg. (rubber-wood) is widely used at
                          present in packing cases, match industry and also as fire-wood. This plantation raw material is now
                          available in large quantities. However, for the effective utilisation of this timber, steps should
                          be taken to diversify its uses as a construction material including in marine structures. The
                          present paper deals with the natural durability of rubber-wood against marine borers in Goa waters.
                          Test panels of rubber-wood were completely destroyed within a short period of seven months due to
                          severe attack by marine borers indicating their very low natural resistance. Wood-borers encountered
                          were Martesia striata (Linnaeus), Nausitora hedleyi Schepman, Bankia rochi Moll, Lyrodus
                          pedicellatus (Quatrefages) and Bankia campanellata Moll and Roch. The need for improving the

                          floating fender, etc. and stored in log-ponds along the coast is prone to rapid biodeterioration.
                          The diverse animal groups which are responsible for the destruction are fungi, bacteria, bivalve
                          molluscs of families Teredinidae and Pholadidae and members of the crustacean families
                          Sphaeromatidae and Limnoriidae. The combined action of the wood-borers with their highly specialised
                          adaptations for boring into wood and leading a sedentary life, causes enormous damage to timber. The
                          annual loss involved to the fishing industry alone for providing protective measures against
                          biodeterioration is over 250 million rupees.Methods to combat biodeterioration of timber in marine
                          conditions range from indigenous coating formulations and protection through a mechanical barrier to
                          pressure impregnation with wood preservatives. Of these, pressure treatment is the most effective.
                          For protecting timber stored in log-ponds, methods like poisoning the neighbouring water with sodium
                          arsenite, wrapping the logs with plastic sheets or CCA-treated coir rope or plastering with an
                          extremely thin layer of cement or a bituminous compound or even bark protection are recommended.
                          Even the best methods sometimes fail due to one reason or the other and marine wood biodeterioration
                          continues to be a serious problem. Search for effective and long-lasting control measures is,
                          therefore, essential for the effective utilisation of timber under marine conditions.</p>

                        <p>Shipworms as destroyers of timber, par excellence, in the marine environment are well known from
                          very ancient times. They attacked the wooden hulls of ships in such intensity that the weakened
                          bottom planks broke up even due to a mild impact caused by hitting on a rock or any floating object.
                          This leads to catastrophic leaks resulting in the ultimate disappearance of the ship even in
                          comparatively calm seas. The paper presents an account of the unhappy encounters between early
                          navigators and marine wood-borers and some interesting anecdotes, compiled from a survey of
                          literature upto the nineteenth century. As many as 17 references have been cited. The seriousness
                          with which early mariners faced the problem of biodeterioration and the scare the wood-borers
                          created in their minds have been brought to light, with, in some cases, excerpts from their journals
                          and books. The instances referred to are, among others, the voyages of Christopher Columbus, Sir
                          Richard Hawkins, Sir Francis Drake, Francois Cauche, Dampier and Captain James Cook. The anxiety and
                          concern for protecting the ships from the ravages of wood-borers and for their own safety, as
                          evidenced from their accounts, are discussed. Based on the information gathered from recorded
                          history, it is suggested that marine borers were instrumental in inducing early shipwrecks, thereby

                          specimens of Nausitora hedleyi, Bankia campanellata, Bankia rochi and Lyrodus pedicellatus were also
                          present in some of them. The results, when compared with those collected by previous investigators
                          from other localities along the Indian coast, indicate the extreme severity of the hazard of marine
                          wood biodeterioration along Goa coast, as some of the timber species are reportedly more durable in
                          other places from where data are available. Factors responsible for such variations in durability of
                          the same timber species at different localities are also briefly discussed.</p>

                        <p>Teak (Tectona grandis) is the most preferred timber for use under marine and brackish-water
                          conditions in India - in boat and ship building, construction of fixed and floating harbour
                          structures and for several other uses. Phenomenal hikes in its price, coupled with widening
                          supply-demand gap, necessitate an urgent rational approach to its utilisation and conservation.
                          Against this background, results on the performance of teak in marine exposure trials conducted at
                          various localities along the Indian coasts over the past three decades are examined with a view to
                          providing suggestions for its proper utilisation. Aspects covered include brief discussion on the
                          principal marine borer species damaging teak, virulence of their attack and the resistance of teak
                          to biodeterioration in the untreated condition as well as after preservative treatment. Timber
                          species that are more durable than teak under marine conditions have been listed. Many of these
                          species, being cheaper and easily available, are potential substitutes for teak, especially in the
                          construction of simple structural units (eg. jetty piles). However, in the fabrication of composite
                          structural units (with member components subjected to divergent stresses as in boat-building),
                          monospecific substitution may not be possible, as the suggested 'secondary species' are not as
                          versatile as teak. In such cases, multi-species usage is recommended. Pressure treatment with
                          preservatives like Copper-Chrome-Arsenic (CCA), Copper-Chrome-Boric (CCB) and Creosote - Fuel oil
                          (50:50) mixture was found to enhance the durability of several inferior varieties of timber species
                          to the level of or even better than teak, indicating the immense potential for the commercialisation
                          and popularisation of the protective technologies involved in the best interest of rational
                          utilisation and conservation of already depleted timber resources. However, introduction of
                          preservative-treated timber in plank-built designs poses certain problems and the technological gaps
                          that need be filled up are discussed. The pattern of current use of teak in marine constructions and
                          its future in the changing context are also discussed.</p>

                          of seven months. The degradation of wood cell walls in both the timber samples occurred due to
                          infestation of soft-rot fungi and tunnelling bacteria. African rosewood, which was severely damaged
                          by teredinids and pholads, was also heavily degraded by both soft-rot fungi and tunnelling bacteria.
                          In contrast, Brazilian jackwood, which effectively resisted teredinids and was only mildly attacked
                          by pholads, was also less severely degraded by the above microorganisms. Thus, the study

                          test panels exposed in Goa waters (west coast of India) for a period of 7 months. All the timber
                          species, except Cleistanthus collinus, were heavily destroyed within 7 months on account of the
                          combined attack by Martesia striata (Linnaeus) and Lyrodus pedicellatus (Quatrefages). C. collinus,
                          though harboured numerous M. striata, did not suffer internal damage (only less than 2%), as the
                          growth of borers was very much restricted. This is attributed to the presence of certain
                          lignan-lactone glycosides like Cleistanthin-C and Cleistanthin-D in the wood. Similarly, species

                          wetland habitat with a water spread of 674 sq. km., which has considerable economic, cultural,
                          scientific and recreational value. It supports a population of 2 lakhs of people in its 46 bed
                          (island) and 76 belt (bordering) villages. The prime occupation of especially the people in the
                          'bed' villages is fishing. Besides conventional capture fishing, considerable scope exists for
                          aquaculture operations in the identified 2.8 sq. km. of wasteland in and around the lake, which is
                          currently being tapped. An enormous quantity of lignicolous materials, especially bamboo
                          (Dendrocalamus strictus, D. hamiltonii, Bambusa arundinaria, etc.) is currently being utilised in
                          fishing operations for diverse purposes, the most striking of which being the unique fencing screens
                          - locally called 'Dadikattus' (Telugu) that may run even upto to 10 km in length. It is also
                          extensively used in packing, transportation operations apart from a number of other miscellaneous
                          purposes. Annual requirement of bamboos in the lake is estimated to be around 30 lakh numbers. The
                          bamboo is subjected to biodeterioration - microbial degradation in freshwater areas and
                          additionally, by boring organisms like Martesia striata, Sphaeroma spp. and teredinids in the areas

                          fishermen spend as much as 25% of their total income. This paper while highlighting the importance
                          and role of bamboo in the economy of Kolleru Lake inhabitants that may typically reflect the

                          was studied by exposing test blocks in the Mandovi estuary, Goa (West coast of India) for periods
                          ranging from five to fifty one months. Panels were installed both in a mangrove habitat (at Chorao),
                          as well as in the estuary (at Betim). Examination of the wood samples revealed the occurrence of
                          atleast fourteen species of fungi. Periconia prolifica, Lignincola laevis, Aniptodera sp. and
                          Lulworthia sp. were common in panels exposed in the mangrove area, while P. prolifica, Halosphaeria
                          quadricornuta and Humicola alopallonella were abundant in panels immersed in the estuary. H.
                          quadricornuta and P. prolifica were frequent in treated wood. It was also found that CCA was more
                          effective than CCB in preventing fungal infestation. Fungal species diversity between the mangrove
                          and non-mangrove areas and also between treated and untreated wood panels has been discussed,
                          together with notes on the probable role of fungi in supporting specific wood-borers in the mangrove

                        <p>Observations on the progression of development of fouling communities at Visakhapatnam on the
                          eastern coast of India carried out over a two-year period are presented. The study was conducted at
                          two stations, Station I and Station II, having widely differing ecological conditions. While rapid
                          colonization was a feature common to both stations, there were differences in the emergence of
                          dominant species and sequence of events of community development. In the polluted waters of Station
                          I, the introduced bivalve, Mytilopsis sallei gained virtual monopoly within 30 days, almost
                          eliminating all other species. Dominance was shared by different species (spirorbids, bryozoans,
                          barnacles, sponges, oysters) at different stages in the relatively cleaner waters of Station II.
                          Factors involved in community development such as new recruits, biological interactions and physical
                          disturbances are discussed. Because the dominance gained by some species in the community does not
                          appear to involve an orderly or directional process that is predictable or involve modifications of
                          the physical environment, it is argued that they should best be regarded as "multiple stable points"
                          rather than "climax communities". This appears to be applicable in many Indian, subtropical and
                          other tropical harbours.</p>

                          solutions with coal tar and heavy petroleum, creosant, pentachlorophenol, copper resinate and
                          copper-chrome-arsenic were tested in preliminary trials during 1957-1964. With the exception of
                          pentachlorophenol, all the preservatives offered resistance to borer attack in varying degrees.
                          Long-term extended tests (17 years) were also conducted with copper-chrome-arsenic; creosote: fuel
                          oil (50:50) mixture and, in recent years, with copper-chrome-boric. In these tests, the service life
                          of several species was found to increase many fold after preservative treatment (some to 17 years),
                          and even very nondurable timbers (eg., Bombax ceiba) were found to fare equally well or better than
                          some of the naturally durable and much preferred species after preservative treatment. However,
                          performance of the preservatives was extremely variable. There were differences not only among the
                          same wood species at different harbors but also between samples from different regions. Doubling the
                          dosage absorption did not enhance the durability correspondingly.</p>

                        <p>Catamaran is a conventional fishing craft fabricated by lashing 4-6 shaped logs of soft timber
                          together. Over 73,000 of these craft fabricated out of 165,000 m3 of wood are in use along the vast
                          east coast of India. Each craft lasts for 5-7 years. Over 15,000 m3 of timber is required annually
                          for repairs and replacements of the craft. Such huge demand exerts enormous pressure on the
                          resources. It is apt, therefore, to extend the practice of wood preservation to the catamaran sector
                          and conserve the precious raw material. In order to achieve this objective, our Institute took up
                          technology demonstrations way back in 1968. However, because of illiteracy and socio-economic
                          constraints of the traditional fishermen, the efforts did not catch up well. Under these
                          circumstances, as a renewed measure of propagation, treatment of 3 each of fresh as well as
                          inservice catamarans was taken up some time ago. The results of pressure impregnation of these six
                          catamarans made of Albizzia falcataria timber with copper-chrome-arsenic (CCA) preservative were
                          analyzed to understand the preservative absorption of the constituent logs. The study revealed that
                          there was no significant variation in the total quantity of chemical absorbed among the fresh as
                          well as inservice catamarans that served for three different periods prior to treatment. However,
                          significant difference was noticed between all the fresh catamarans clubbed as one group and the
                          inservice craft as another group. The CCA absorption ranged from 13.52 to 15.30 kg.m-3 averaging at
                          14.60 kg.m-3 in the fresh craft and 18.65 to 22.10 kg.m-3 averaging at 20.42 kg.m-3 in the in
                          service catamarans. Also, each constituent log of the six catamarans differed in its chemical
                          content from the other. The analysis proved that it is possible to treat the inservice catamarans
                          and achieve good preservative retentions</p>

                          data on biofouling and bioresistance aspects of this valuable material are lacking. Therefore,
                          studies of this kind were taken up for the first time on three commercially important Indian
                          species, namely, Bambusa bambos, B. tulda and Dendrocalamus strictus at Visakhapatnam harbour on the
                          east coast of India. Culms, both in round and half-round form of the three species were found quite
                          conducive to the recruitment of a good number of biofoulants. The half-rounds, of course, have
                          exhibited differential biofouling on the outer and inner surfaces. The three species of bamboo were
                          also found highly vulnerable to the attack of wood boring teredinids in marine environment. While
                          half-round culms of B. bambos and B. tulda were severely destroyed in a quarter, that of D. strictus
                          and round culms of B. bambos and B. tulda were extensively damaged in two quarters and those of D.
                          strictus in three quarters. The three species of bamboo thus offered suitable substrata for the
                          heavy accumulation of a number of biofoulants besides presenting poor bioresistance against the
                          attack of marine wood borers. The low natural durability of bamboo in sea water indicates a need for
                          urgent adoption of preservative treatment to achieve effective utilisation of the commodity under

                        <p>Hitherto, the most versatile fishing craft of the poor traditional Indian fishermen - the catamaran
                          is made of solid timber logs of a few selected species of broad-leaved softwoods. Of late, the
                          fishermen find it difficult to get these conventional varieties of timber chiefly because of three
                          reasons, a) scarcity of commodity, b) prohibitive costs and c) competition from match and veneer
                          industries. As the state of affairs is turning more and more indocile, the poor traditional
                          fisherman is compelled to look for alternative ways to sustain his dear occupation and trade. As an
                          outcome of such fervent desire, the fishermen in the north east coast of Andhra Pradesh initiated
                          building up catamarans purely from the wooden planks without sacrificing much of the original shape,

                          wooden structures from the biodeteriorating activity of such organisms, the wood is treated with
                          different chemical formulations to prolong their service life. Copper chrome arsenic (CCA) is one
                          such wood preservative chemical offering excellent protection to wood under marine conditions. Field
                          observations with CCA treated test stakes as well as actual wooden structures have, however, shown

                          the most virulent teredinid wood borer at Visakhapatnam harbour, East Coast of India. As a first
                          step, experiments were conducted on this aspect under copper stress. The results show that in situ
                          oxygen consumption of the animal under normal conditions was found to range from 0.8 - 5.6
                          μl.mg-1.hr-1 averaging 2.43 μl.mg-1.hr-1. Under acute toxicity of 0.5 ppm copper, the oxygen demand
                          was observed to fall almost to half the normal levels (0.4 - 3.5 μl.mg-1.hr-1), but showed a gradual
                          increase subsequently during the next 24 hours. However, when the stress was continued for 96 hours,
                          the oxygen uptake gradually decreased again to 0.2 - 2.1 μl.mg-1. hr-1.</p>

                        <p>Deterioration of timber by biological agencies under marine conditions is a highly complex problem
                          affecting diverse maritime operations. In India, the additional expenditure incurred by the fishing
                          industry alone for providing remedial measures against wood infesting organisms is a staggering
                          figure of over 400 million rupees. Of the different techniques employed to control biodeterioration,
                          impregnation of wood by preservatives that contain biocidal chemicals is the most widely accepted
                          method. In this method, the toxicants are gradually released by the leaching action of sea water to
                          provide control. Inorganic compounds of heavy metals (copper, arsenic, zinc, etc.) have been the
                          principal biocides used extensively in the 'wood preservatives' for many years. More recently, the
                          trend has been to use organo-metallic compounds (TBTO, etc.). These chemicals, although very
                          effective, are potentially important sources of contamination. In the current context of growing
                          concern for maintenance of purity of aquatic systems, environmental compatibility is bound to play
                          an increasingly restrictive role in the usage of wood preservatives especially in areas of high
                          boating activity (ports, near shore environs, etc.) and in specialised situations like
                          marine/brackish water fish-farms and sites near coastal industrial establishments. In this paper,
                          the possibilities for evolving non-polluting, environmentally acceptable protectants are examined in
                          detail. Emphasis is laid on control of the biological 'weak links' in the life 'cycles of the
                          destructive organisms and usage of natural anti-biodeterioration compounds, occurring either in
                          bioresistant woods or in marine orga.nisms.</p>

                          and constitute nearly 70% of the total traditional craft. They arc entirely made of wood, The
                          species of wood being used in fabrication of catamarans contains mostly sapwood and is susceptible
                          to fungal decay. Earlier, it was assumed that catamaran logs are not destroyed by teredinids and
                          pholadids since they are used for eight hours in seawater and kept on the shore the rest of the day,
                          But the fact is, not so. To substantiate this fact, an instance of heavy destruction inflicted by
                          marine wood borers to catamarans at Pudimadaka, a fishing village located 60 km south of
                          Visakhapatnam is reported in this paper. The monetary loss resulting from such destruction and
                          associated repairs arc outlined and the need for adoption of wood preservation technology in the
                          treatment of catamarans is stressed</p>

                          evaluated under marine conditions. The data were compared with that obtained from elsewhere in the

                          non-conventional species in warding off marine borer attack. Therefore, it is recommended that the
                          non-conventional species may also be used in the fabrication of catamarans to lessen pressure on the

                          two stations, Station I and Station 11, having widely differing ecological conditions. While rapid
                          colonization was a feature common to both stations, there were differences in the emergence of
                          dominant species and sequence of events of community development. In the polluted waters of Station
                          I, the introduced bivalve Mytilopsis sallei gained virtual monopoly within 30 days, almost
                          eliminating all other species. Dominance was shared by different species (spirorbids, bryozoans,
                          barnacles, sponges, oysters) at different stages in the relatively cleaner waters of Station II.
                          Factors involved in community development such as new recruits, biological interactions, and
                          physical disturbances are discussed. Because the dominance gained by some species in the community
                          does not appear to involve an orderly or directional process that is predictable or involve
                          modifications of the physical environment, it is argued that they should best be regarded as
                          "multiple stable points" rather than "climax communities." This appears to be applicable in many

                        <p>Catamaran is a conventional fishing craft fabricated by lashing 4-6 shaped logs of soft timber
                          together. Over 73,000 of these craft fabricated out of 165,000 m3 of wood are in use along the vast
                          east coast of India. Each craft lasts for 5-7 years. Over 15,000 m3 of timber is required annually
                          for repairs and replacements of the craft. Such huge demand exerts enormous pressure on the
                          resources. It is apt, therefore, to extend the practice of wood preservation to the catamaran sector
                          and conserve the precious raw material. In order to achieve this objective, our institute took up
                          technology demonstrations way back in 1968. However, because of illiteracy and socio-economic
                          constraints of the traditional fishermen , the efforts did not catch up well. Under these
                          circumstances, as a renewed measure of propagation, treatment of 3 each of fresh as well as in
                          service catamarans was taken up some time ago. The results of pressure impregnation of these six
                          catamarans made of Albizzia falcataria timber with copper chrome arsenic (CCA) preservative were
                          analyzed to understand the preservative absorption of the constituent logs. The study revealed that
                          there was no significant variation in the total quantity of chemical absorbed among the fresh as
                          well as in service catamarans that served for three different periods prior to treatment. However,
                          significant difference was noticed between all the fresh catamarans clubbed as one group and the in
                          service craft as another group. The CCA absorption ranged from 13.52 to 15.30 kg. m3 in the in
                          service catamarans. Also, each constituent log of the sic catamarans differed in its chemical
                          content from the other. The analysis proved that it is possible to treat the in-service catamarans
                          and achieve good preservative retentions.</p>

                          chemical loading in various species of timber required for different end uses. In order to gain more
                          insight into this aspect, the residual CCA content in 40 treated timber panels belonging to 14
                          species removed on destruction by marine organisms from a series of durability tests conducted in
                          Kochi waters (west coast, India) were estimated. The data showed that CCA enhanced the durability of
                          various timber species to different degrees. In the case of panels treated to lower loading, the
                          average annual leaching of CCA ranged from 0.36-2.81 kg.m-3 and that in specimens subjected to
                          higher loading from 0.54-4.99 kg.m3. The leaching rate was found to be relatively slower in panels
                          with higher loading than that with lower loading. In general, the leaching rate of CCA was seen
                          varying among panels of different species, panels with identical initial preservative content and
                          even among various panels within a species. The study thus suggests the requirement of in-depth
                          field studies into the various aspects governing the leaching phenomenon of preservatives used under

                        <p>Lyrodus pedicellatus (Quatrefages), a teredinid wood borer, is one of the most virulent marine
                          borers at Visakhapatnam outer harbour area. In order to protect wooden structures from its attack
                          among others, the structures are treated with wood preservatives, especially copper-chrome-arsenic
                          (CCA) composition. Normally, a preservative loading of 32 kg.m'3 of CCA is recommended to protect
                          timber under marine conditions in tropical Indian waters. To determine the optimum retention of CCA
                          required to prevent the attack of L. pedicellatus, experiments were conducted on the larvae of the
                          species. Test coupons of Pinus roxburghii treated to different CCA retentions were offered to the
                          larvae for attack. Recruitment of larvae was monitored continuously till they succeed. Also,

                          species. The activity of the organisms was recorded at 24 hour intervals, upto 96 hours. The boring
                          activity of the animals in controls as well as treated coupons was determined. The results are

                        <p>Due to shortage of timber coupled with other compelling factors, traditional fishermen along the
                          east coast of India, especially of Andhra Pradesh, of late, are departing from conventional log.
                          type wooden catamarans. Instead, they are fabricating catamarans out of timber planks of hard woods
                          and utilizing thermocol for buoyancy. Mostly, locally available timber of a Combretaceae species,
                          Anogeissus acuminata (Yon) is used to fabricate these plank-built catamarans. Since these catamarans
                          are also built with untreated timber, there is every need to extend wood preservation technology to
                          these craftmen so as to achieve enhanced service life and conserve the resources. Therefore, the
                          Institute of Wood Science and Technology took up treatment of timber meant for five such craft with
                          copper- chrome-arsenic (CCA). Thirteen different logs were. procured and converted into planks and
                          batons of suitable sizes, debarked, cleaned and air dried under shade. While the length of the
                          planks ranged from 0.81 to 6.53 m, the width varied from 16 to 44 cm. After sufficient seasoning,
                          the material was pressure treated with 6% CCA by full cell method as per IS: 401 (1982). Chemical
                          retentions were computed from the weight gained by the individual planks and sets of 20 batons
                          immediately after treatment. The preservative absorption in the planks ranged from 13;05 to 69.80
                          kg/m3 averaging at 25.90 kg/m3 and that in the batons averaged at 32 kg/m3. The quantity of CCA
                          absorbed by the planks was analyzed with reference to their length, width, thickness and volume.
                          Planks when categorized to different length and volume groups exhibited clear difference in the
                          intake of chemical by them but when categorized into different width and thickness classes showed
                          not much variation. All the treated planks and batons after air drying in shade for 15 days were
                          fabricated into five catamarans. Thus, though the planks of A acuminata are either very long or very
                          wide, they showed a positive response to CCA treatment by absorbing reasonably good quantities of
                          preservative. Similarly, on fabrication of the catamarans, an average retention of 21.79 to 25.43
                          kg/m3 of CCA per craft could be achieved. These values fall into the recommended preservative
                          absorption range of 16 to 32 kg/m3 (IS: 401; 1982) for marine structures.</p>

                          studies of this kind were taken up for the first time on three commercially important Indian
                          species, namely, Bambusa bambos, B.tulda and Dendrocalamus strictus at Visakhapatnam harbour on the
                          east coast of India. Culms, both in round an half round form of the three species were found quite
                          conductive to the recruitment of a good number of biofoulants. The half rounds of course, have
                          exhibited differential biofouling on the outer and inner surfaces. The tree species of bamboo were
                          also found highly vulnerable to the attack of wood boring teredinids in marine environments. While
                          half round culms of B.bambos and B.tulda were severely destroyed in a quarter, that of D.strictus
                          and round culms of B.bambus and B.tulda were extensively damaged in two quarters and those of
                          D.strictus in three quarters. The three species of bamboo thus offered suitable substrata for the
                          heavy accumulation of a number of biofoulants besides presenting poor bioresistance against the
                          attack of marine wood borers. The low natural durability of bamboo in sea water indicates a need for
                          urgent adoption of preservative treatment to achieve effective utilization of the commodity under

                          is compelled to look for alterative ways to sustain his dear occupation and trade. As an outcome of
                          such fervent desire, the fishermen in the north east coast of Andhra Pradesh initiated building up

                          From time immemorial, the ethnic groups forming part and parcel of the forest ecosystem have been
                          practicing some taboos, totems and myths relating to the preservation of flora and fauna in the form
                          of sacred groves. Mangrove forests are regarded as the most productive and biodiverse wetlands on
                          the earth, and an important natural reserve of biological diversity. They are a source for wood
                          products- timber, poles and posts, firewood, charcoal, non-wood products such as fodder, honey, wax,
                          tannin, dye, medicines and material for thatching as well as aquatic products such as fish, prawns,
                          crabs, oysters, mullets and mussels. The ethnobiological information thus gathered from the coastal

                          used for further scientific investigations. The ethnobiological information also can play a

                          especially of the East Coast of Andhra Pradesh to part with their conventional log type wooden
                          catamarans. Instead, the fishermen are fabricating catamarans out of timber planks of hard woods
                          alongwith thermocol. Mostly, locally available timber of a Combretaceae member, namely, Anogeissus
                          acuminata (Pasi, Yon) is employed in the fabrication. Usually, these catamarans are also built with
                          untreated timber and hence there is a need to treat them with wood preservatives to ensure a long
                          service life and as well to conserve the resources. Therefore, the Institute of Wood Science and
                          Technology took up treatment of timber meant for fIVe such craft with copper-chrome-arsenic (CCA)

                          solid timber logs of a few selected species of broad-leaved softwoods so far. However, of late the
                          fishermen find it difficult to get these conventional varieties of timber due to scarcity of
                          commodity, prohibitive costs and competition from match and veneer industries. As the state of
                          affairs is turning more and more indocile, the poor traditional fisherman is compelled to look for
                          alternative ways to sustain his dear occupation and trade. As an outcome of such fervent desire, the
                          fishermen in the north east coast of Andhra Pradesh initiated building up catamarans solely from the
                          wooden planks without sacrificing much of the conventional shape, convenience and carrying capacity.
                          The design and fabrication aspects of these plank-built catamarans are documented in this paper.</p>

                          cause huge monetary losses. They are site specific and their distribution depends on the water
                          quality of a particular area. Seven species of wood borers such as Martesia striata, Teredo
                          furcifera, T.parksi, Lyrodus pedicellatus, L.bipartita, Bankia companellata and B.carinata have been
                          identified in the present study. This paper deals with the nature, distribution and growth of wood
                          borers at three ports in Andhra Pradesh, i.e. Krishnapatnam, Kakinada and Visakhapatnam during
                          November, 1993 to October 1995. The results of exposure trials (test coupons) are discussed in the

                        <p>Catamaran, the most versatile fishing craft of the traditional Indian fishermen used to be
                          fabricated of solid timber logs of a few selected species of broad-leaved softwoods, so far.
                          However, of late, the fishermen have been finding it difficult to get these conventional varieties
                          of timber due to scarcity of commodity, prohibitive costs and competition from match and veneer
                          industries. In an effort to find alternative material for building catamaran, the fishermen in the
                          northeast coast of Andhra Pradesh have started building catamarans solely from the wooden planks of
                          hard wood using thermocol as buouant material without sacrificing much of the conventional shape,
                          convenience and carrying capacity. The design and fabrication aspects of these plank-built

                          especially of the northeast coast of Andhra Pradesh to part with their conventional log type wooden
                          catamaran in recent times. The fishermen have started fabricating catamarns out of timber planks of
                          hard woods along with thermocol. Mostly, locally available timber of a Combreataceae member, viz.,
                          Anogeissus acuminate is employed in the fabrication. Usually, these catamarans are also built with
                          untreated timber and hence there is a need to treat them with wood preservatives to ensure a long
                          service life. Therefore, the Institute of Wood Science and Technology took up treatment of timber
                          meant for five such craft with copper-chrome arsenic(CCA) wood preservative, fabricated the craft
                          and launched them into service through the fishermen beneficiaries. Details of timber dressing,

                          etc., Mangroves provided shelter to vast fishery resources, which generate livelihood and support
                          scores of coastal populace directly or indirectly. They also render good habitat for the migratory
                          avifauna and rich wildlife. A total of 90 mangrove species are so far reported from around the
                          world. Of these, 69 are present in India. Among these, 35 species occur in Andhra Pradesh state. Of
                          these, 16 species are categorized as true mangroves that require both seawater and river water.
                          Information so far reported on the status, diversity and distribution of these mangroves was very
                          inconsistent differing from one researcher to the other. Taxonomy of the mangroves in the state is
                          also often confusing because of lack of distinction between true mangroves and associated species.
                          At present, mangroves are under serious threat due to both natural calamities like cyclones and
                          tsunamis and biological adversities like diseases and bioinvasions. Also, anthropongenic pressures

                          associated with or influenced by the vegetation around. Primitive man was entirely dependent on
                          nature for his survival relying on plants and animals for his food, shelter, clothing, material
                          culture and medicine. Thus the primitive man has become a repository of knowledge of the economic
                          and medicinal plants around him. In Andhra Pradesh, the tribal communities in general are confined
                          to isolated hills and valleys in addition to the adjacent plains of Godavari valley. Their main
                          occupation is agriculture and collection of forest resources. The tribes practice podu cultivation
                          (shifting cultivation) on hill slopes and plough cultivation in plains. Equally he has recognized
                          animal power as good source of energy for tilling the land, transportation of men and materials.
                          Further, the tribes rear pigs, cows, buffalos, goats, fowls, etc. for deriving more economic
                          benefits. Similar to their sole dependence on folk medicines and herbal remedies for treating own
                          ailments, the acquired knowledge is used to treat the diseased animals also. Even today, the tribes
                          do not have easy access to modern veterinary medicines or doctors and have to rely on their own
                          traditional knowledge, which, of course, is practical, effective, cheap and readily available. In
                          Andhra Pradesh, not much work has been done on the diversity of ethno veterinary plants so far.
                          Hence, a study was taken up to improve and document such traditional knowledge. As a result, 35
                          noteworthy ethno-veterinary plant species (either lesser known or unknown) comprising of 33 genera
                          falling under 21 families were brought to light. The information about the plant/plant parts used
                          mode of application and dosage were gathered from the tribes, namely, Konda reddis, Konda kammaras,
                          Koyas and valmikis. The same was crosschecked, critically analyzed and documented. The specimens are

                          mangroves along the coast of Kerala, Karnataka and Goa. A total of 150 species belonging to 52
                          families of 10 orders were founding the mangals of the west coast. The trophic composition of the
                          insect component of the mangroves was analyzed. The study revealed that in addition to a few species
                          that are exclusive to this ecosystem, mangroves also harbour a few pests of agricultural crops and
                          other forest tree species. The insect population was monitored bimonthly using a sticky trap and the
                          diversity computed. The observations are discussed in this paper

                          (7-17%). For the removal of USM 10 gm sandal seed oil (USM 8.8%) was dissolved in 100 ml

                          with 4 x 100 ml cold water), a white waxy stuff separated out. After filtration, the solvent was

                          samples showed considerable enhanced resistance to fungi and termites. This may be due to the

                        <p>Creosote or coal tar creosote is most successfully and commonly used wood preservative throughout
                          the world with good service life of 30-50 years. But, it has certain disadvantages like obnoxious
                          odour, unpleasant colour and unpaintability. Sometimes bleeding from treated wood creates harm and
                          nuisance to environment. Creosote oil was steam distilled to get clean and less odorous steam
                          volatile product (SVC). The yield was 30% and its chemical composition was identified by HPLC.
                          Acridine, 2 methyl naphtalene, acenaphthne and O-xylene were among the chemical constituents
                          identified in the steam volatile creosote. The efficacy of this SVC was investigated against wood
                          rotters, mould and stain fungi and termites and was fond to be effective as natural creososte but
                          with added advantages like improved colour and lessened obnoxious odour. The method of obtaining SVC
                          is economical and it is effective as natural creosote with the advantages of improved colour, odour

                        <p>Sandal (Santalum alubm L) is indigenous to peninsular India. It is distributed naturally over 9600
                          km2, mainly in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Sandal is capable of growing on all types of soils.
                          Phenological, morphological and genetic variations were reported in eight identified potential
                          provenances. Present method of cultivation, field planting, silvicultural and management practices,
                          heartwood formation, yield and revenue were discussed. The fragrant heartwood is used for carving
                          and religious purposes and the essential oil from it is used in perfumery and cosmetics. The oil
                          contains 90% of Santalols and has been the prime focus in fragrances industry. A non destructive
                          rapid method of estimating sandal oil content in heartwood (core samples) was developed. HESP and
                          ESPO- two new aroma oils have been prepared from spent sandal powder. Large demand for wood and oil
                          in domestic and international market has prompted for over exploitation illegally and has led to

                        <p>Sandalwood is the fragrant heartwood of Santalum album Linn. The tree is mainly exploited for its
                          heartwood which yeilds the famous East Indian sandalwood oil by steam distillation. The heartwood is
                          one of the best woods for intricate carving and tuning and about 5% of annual production of wood is
                          being used for this purpose. Age of heartwood influences the quality and content of oil. A simple
                          non-destructive, rapid, UV spectroscopic method was developed to estimate oil content of living
                          trees, by taking core samples of heartwood. Sapwood of sandal from sandalwood depot still contains
                          0.4% to 6% of oil due to over dressing of sandal logs. It finds use in agarbathis, carving, turning
                          and toy making. Sandalwood oil is used in soap, perfumery, cosmetic and agarbathi industries.
                          Fixative property and tenacious aroma of the oil are mainly due to (α and β santalols (C15 H24 O)
                          constituting about 90% of oil. Exhausted sandalwood powder on hydrolysis and oxidation yields new
                          essential oils (HESP and ESPO) (about 1%) which are different from natural steam distilled sandal

                          In urban areas, per capita fuelwood consumption decreases with increase in the population of town.
                          It was found that agriculture waste forms an important source of fuel in rural areas. Dependence on
                          forest is much less than was envisaged. Source of wood fuel is farm forestry/trees on roadside, on
                          bunds and marginal land.</p>

                        <p>Energy is an important input in the process of development. In fact, the level of development is
                          generally measured by per capita energy consumption. The most convenient energy source, the fossil
                          fuels are fast depleting due to rapid growth in population and urbanization and its large scale use
                          is contributing a lot to global warming. The other energy sources are being worked up to improve and
                          enhance them as alternate sources as well as to save the environment. One such renewable source of
                          energy is biomass. Huge quantity of biomass is produced and replenished each year as a result of
                          photosynthesis. Apart from this, huge quantities of biomass wastes are generated by agricultural,
                          household, institutional and industrial activities of men. This available biomass contain
                          significant amount of energy and have potential to be used as an alternative energy source. The
                          present paper discusses the availability of biomass in India and means of its effective conversion

                          tight storage is the cheapest and the best method up to 9 to 12 months. Seeds collected from younger
                          and older trees have alike showing that age has no effect on the viability and germination. To
                          overcome dormancy and to hasten germination, either removal of outer seed coat on treatment with
                          0.05% gibberellic acid for 12 to 15 hours is found suitable. Studies on germination capacity of

                          morphologically and physiologically. Data on seed parameters showed significant variation between
                          different seed sources. Highest range of seed length is noted in seeds from Mulbagal provenance
                          (10.27-6.25 mm with a mean of 7.87, SE � 0.1), whereas the lowest has been observed in Mysore
                          provenance (8.92-7.45 mm with a mean of 8.0 SE� 0.08). Similarly, the highest seed width was
                          observed in Mandagadde provenance (7.79-6.09 mm with a mean of 7.16 SE � 0.03). For seed weight, the
                          highest was in Honagal provenance (0.34-0.11 mm with a mean of 0.12 SE � 0.005.) and the lowest was
                          in Marayoor provenance (0.022-0.08 mm with a mean of 0.16 SE � 0.003). The coefficient of variation
                          (CV), which helps in comparing variability among different provenances, has been calculated. The
                          highest CV for seed length was recorded in Mandagadde provenance (15.0%) followed by Mulbagal
                          provenance (12.2%) CV for seed width is highest Mysore provenance (14.0%) followed by Shimoga
                          (11.9%). The same has been observed for seed weight in Honagal provenance (29.3%) which is highest,
                          followed by Bangalore provenance 27.7%). The distribution patterns of CV among different provenances
                          and in seed characteristics indicate the presence of natural variability in those provenances. Some
                          outstanding trees may be selected from those provenances which showed highest CV for different seed
                          characteristics, and may be incorporated as base population while establishing second generation
                          seed orchards of sandal at different places. This is prerequisite for formulating a multiple

                        <p>A study was conducted in a Himalayan moist temperate forest in Mandal to identify the patterns of
                          seed germination and major germination syndromes operating in the forest and to understand the role
                          of primary selective factors in controlling germination in the plant community and how groups of
                          species respond to such factors. The germination pattern was bimodal with the peak time of emergence
                          in June followed by February-March. Along the altitudinal gradient (1650 to 2600 masl) the maximum
                          number of seedlings emerging per transect higher elevations canopy tree species seemed to dominate
                          in the regeneration transect. The mean length of dormancy (MLD) of species recorded in field nursery
                          trials in Mandal ranged from 10 days to 285 days. Seasonal analysis of the germination pattern
                          revealed that maximum number of species dispersed their seed during dry season (Oct-Jan) as compared
                          to rainy or pre rainy season. Three germination groups: delayed rainy (DR), intermediate-dry (ID)
                          and rapid rainy (RR) were identified as the major germination syndromes in the study area. Among the

                          a regression equation (RE) and a fixed coefficient (FC) to calculate the LA of teak seedlings
                          growing in forest nurseries. The regression equation, Leaf Area = (L*W)* 0.543 +2.967, was derived
                          by taking actual leaf area as dependent variable and product of L and W as independent variable (r=
                          0.988). The FC calculated by taking the ratio of actual to product of L and W was found to be 0.579.
                          The equation and coefficient was validated and was found significant. The study indicated that

                          and size of container to be used is of prime importance when we have to achieve the above objective.
                          Ever since containerized seedling production was adopted during early 70 s, various kinds of
                          containers were used to grow seedlings. The present research work was carried out to analyze the
                          economics of seedling production in polybags as well as root trainers to assess their growth and
                          economics. The present studies reveal that the container size and type (root trainers; 90cc 150cc
                          and 270 cc block type) and polybags (4 x6" and 5 X6") have a significant effect on the species under
                          study. Results indicate that 150cc root trainer result in seedlings that are suitable for planting
                          within 5 months. Although the seedlings in 270cc root trainers and 5 x6" polybag produce seedlings
                          with better overall growth, but cost index for both are higher than 150cc root trainers. The cost of
                          production for 1,00,000 seedlings in 150cc root trainers was Rs. 42, 996.57 whereas incase of 270cc
                          root trainers, 4x6" polybag, 5 x6" polybag and 4x6" polybag with traditional potting mixture it was
                          found to be 68,191.53; 82,284.70; 1,06,771.80 and 78,125.50 respectively. Therefore, it would be
                          advisable to take up large-scale production of seedlings in 150cc root trainers. However, if the
                          seedlings are to be retained for a period more than 5 months 270cc root trainers are recommended.

                          observed that removal of primary root at different stages of development does not affect germination
                          or seedling growth; any seed fragment that contains vasculature produces a root and shoot
                          irrespective of its size and position with precise polarity; and , a seed from which a seedling has
                          germinated is capable of producing another seedling. We propose that the regenerative capacity of
                          seed fragments could be a unique strategy for exploiting mammalian frugivory for seed dispersal.</p>

                  <p>Tasar culture is an ideal forest based industry attuned to the nature and the needs of our
                    socio-economic milieu. For centuries, tasar culture remained obscure as an exclusive craft and
                    tradition of the hillfolks and aboriginals, inhabiting the forest tracts of Central and
                    North-eastern India. In recent years, this tribal tradition has assumed importance and attention at
                    the national level. The primary food plants of tropical tasar are Terminalia tomentosa, T. arjuna,
                    Shorea robusta. Thirty eight food plants of secondary importance have also been recorded for the
                    tasar silkworm, Antheraea mylitta D. The production potentialities and steady demand for tasar
                    products abroad has prompted the commercial exploitation of this tribal craft which is now
                    transformed into an industry of immense economic importance. The industry has two components - the
                    rich natural forest resources and the manpower; the challenge is to bring about a balanced
                    development.</p>

                  <p>Among the non timber forest species, Santalum album is economically important because of its high
                    value added products. Commercial plantations on large scale including sandal will go a long way in
                    meeting the demand for its produce and at the same time reduces the pressure on natural forests.
                    Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have not only major sandal bearing areas but also produce 90 percent of
                    countries production. Sandal is valued for its heartwood and oil, which starts when the tree is
                    around 15 years old. Both in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the state has monopoly over its production,
                    protection and disposal both in Government and private plantations. Production and extraction of
                    sandal has been showing a decreasing trend over the years due to depletion in growing stock, overall
                    yield and also policy of the Government. The production and price depends on the demand in the
                    international market, which is on the increase due to multipurpose usage of sandal and its products.
                    The domestic consumption is minimal and the international demand is for a specific class of wood and
                    oil. Oil is used for perfumes and cosmetics and in pharmaceutical preparations. Majority of the
                    export is to the European, Middle East countries and USA. The demand in the international market for
                    sandal products because of its high value, has encouraged illegal trade by way of illicit and
                    indiscriminate felling which resulted in depleted growing stock with high percent of lower girth

                  <p>Bamboo is integral to the culture of south -East Asia. Over 75 genera and 1250 species are reported
                    to occur in the globe. India perhaps has the worlds richest diversity of bamboo, claiming about 130
                    species occurring over an area of 10.05 million ha. This is about 12.8 per cent of the total forest
                    area of the country. The bamboo diversity in natural habitat is dwindling, due to over exploitation,
                    shifting cultivation practices and extensive forest fires. A sustained availability can be ensured
                    only by elaborate bamboo cultivation through community forestry programmes based upon growing trees
                    on public (or) community land as proposed to private farms. The degree of local participation in
                    planting and looking after the tree varies, and the benefits are shared by community as a whole. The
                    methods in raising bamboo plantations through community forestry suggested. Advantages of raising

                  <p>Teak (Tectona grandis L) possesses distinct annual growth rings. Field data on heartwood ring
                    widths were measured on 168 teak trees from three sites viz, virnoli (1958); Bhagavati (1961) and
                    Barchi (1953) which are located within a radius of 20 km from Dandeli (Haliyal Forest Division),
                    Karnataka, India. Four measurements were taken radically from the pith outwards in four directions
                    approximately at 90o from each other at stump height of each tree. Each measurement unit (MV)
                    consisted of five rings. Cohorts with higher growth rates during their initial stages reduced their
                    growth rates towards the end of their juvenile period while those with lower growth rates in their
                    initial stages increased their growth rates. All the cohorts converged towards a common growth at

                  <p>Constant diameter increment for trees belonging to different diameter classes have been reported.
                    It appears that if the radial growth rates have to be constant across trees of different diameters,
                    their initial growth rates must be varying, and at some point of time their growth rate should
                    converge. It is known at variations in the anatomical properties of wood reduce during the
                    transition from juvenile phase to the mature phase of the tree. We tested the hypothesis that radial
                    growth rates of trees belonging to different radial classes converge towards the end of the juvenile
                    phase through stump analysis of teak (Tectona grandis L). Growth pattern of 168 teak trees was
                    analyzed after classifying the trees into four cohorts based on the radial growth accumulated over
                    the initial 20 years. Growth rates varied significantly among cohorts up to 15 years, but converged
                    towards the end of the juvenile phase of tree growth (16-20 years). Correlations show that growth up
                    to 15 years had a significant impact on the cumulative growth. Trees that accured larger growths
                    during the initial 10 years accrued lesser growths during the period between 16-20 years and vice
                    versa showing a clear growth rate compensation. Growth beyond 20 years was relatively constant
                    across the cohorts. It is also shown that competition affects trees that had slower growth initially
                    and has little influence on fast growing ones. We discuss the implications of this study for the
                    management of teak trees. </p>

                  <p>In India, the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) occurs in forested habitats of the Greater
                    Himalaya at 1,200-3,000 m elevation (Sathyakumar 2001). Information on the feeding and movement
                    patterns of Asiatic black bear in India is limited to 2 short studies (Manjrekar 1989, Saberwal
                    1989) and some observations by Schaller (1977), all in Dachigam National Park (NP) in Jammu and
                    Kashmir, India. The Asiatic black bear in India is an omnivore, but feeds mainly on fruits and
                    leaves of few plant species. Consequently, its movement depends largely on the density and
                    distribution of these key food plants in the area. In addition, food production is known to play a
                    major role in reproduction of black bears (Jonkel and Cowan 1971). In Dachigam a major proportion of
                    Asiatic black bear diets were composed initially of sugar-rich fruits, followed by fat rich fruits
                    before hibernation (Manjrekar, 1989).There are few studies available on feeding habits of other bear
                    species and their effects on seed germination. Traveset and Willson (1997) discussed effects of some
                    birds, American black bear (Ursus americanus) and brown bear (Ursus arctos) on seed germination of
                    fleshy-fruited plants in temperate rainforests of southeast Alaska. Their results indicated no
                    difference in germination rates for seeds that passed through the guts of captive birds and black
                    and brown bears; they reported that the advantages of seed dispersal lie more in seed movement away
                    from the parent plant than in seed treatment within the dispenser's gut. McConkey and Galetti
                    (1999), while reporting food and feeding habits of the Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) in
                    Central Borneo, Indonesia, indicated that this species could be an important seed dispenser
                    depending upon the species consumed, number of seeds ingested, and the deposition site. Asiatic
                    black bears are well known seed predators. Manjrekar (1989) reported that acorns (Quercus robur) and
                    walnuts (Juglans regia) were totally crushed by black bears while feeding on them, thereby hindering
                    dispersal. Black bears were also reported to feed on seeds fallen on the ground, and signs of
                    regeneration of species, walnut in particular, were reported to be low. WE present observation on
                    the food and feeding habits of Asiatic black bear and observations on germination of bear food

                  <p>Extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is a significant forest use option in terms of
                    revenue earning potential for the government as well as a source of livelihood option for the
                    dependent indigenous forest communities. The annual employment generation due to NTFP extraction in
                    India is estimated to be over 5 million (Tewari, 1993), of which a considerable proportion accrues
                    to women as compared to men. Currently, there are about 100 million forest dwellers in the country
                    and another 275 million for whom forests have continued to be an important source of livelihood
                    (Lynch, 1992). Over the years, the stakeholders of NTFPs have changed from forest-dependent
                    indigenous communities to State Forest departments (SFDs), commission agents, drug industry and/or
                    co-operative societies. The obvious lack of substitutes, a wide range of stakeholders, tremendous
                    forward linkages associated with NTFPs, and low externalities, should have made NTFP extraction a
                    rather lucrative option. However rapidly additional pressures on forests. Ultimately extraction may
                    have to be delinked from natural forests for the sake of conservation. Economic substitutes for
                    sources of NTFPs without adversely affecting the interests of the stakeholders have to be envisaged.
                    The role of some important stakeholders in this NTFP scenario in tropical dry deciduous forest

                    quality seedlings of teak, bamboo, silver oak, sesbania, subabul and jatropa. Periodical visits to
                    each of these villages are being undertaken by scientists of the institute to monitor these
                    plantations. Farmers are advised on management of plantation and on prophylactic/control measures of

                    Primary stakeholders are native marginal farmers (adivasis) who live nearest to forests. Livelihood
                    base of native farmers was being destabilized by soil degradation, drought, wild animal attacks, and
                    declining access to forests, Economics of feasible land use options among stakeholders was examined

                    understand long term impacts and possible improvements. This was followed by a survey of primary
                    stakeholders to gather occupational and livelihood patterns, costs, benefits and prices associated
                    with land uses. The survey enabled an interactive elicitation process fir arriving at a set of

                  <p>Agroforestry has been identified as a possible solution in overcoming some of the complex problems
                    of subsistence agriculture in the tropics. Integrating trees in farming systems through appropriate
                    agroforestry practices in seen as a way out to diversify and maximize productivity of farmlands.
                    Selected woody components or proven multipurpose tree species (MPTs) may contribute to the overall
                    productivity and sustainability of farmlands in arid and semiarid zones through its various service
                    benefits or direct production functions. MPTs in farmlands impart food security, provide livestock
                    fodder and fuel wood to farmers in the tropics, while in developed economies farmers look for other
                    benefits like shade, shelter, soil protection, improvement of landscape and rural environment. Lack
                    of technological information, especially on silvicultural management poses additional problems in
                    extending tree planting techniques to farmers. Thus, choice of tree species has been confined to a
                    mere handful like Tectona grandis, Casuarina equisetifolia, A.nilotica, A.leucophloea,
                    A.auriculiformis, A.mangium, Eucalyptus sp., Grevellia robusta, Azadirachta indica, Leucaena
                    leucocephala, Sesbania grandiflora and Bamboo, especially in the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu,
                    Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. In farmlands, these trees have been planted in wide-row intercropping
                    systems (for fuel wood, green manure and small timber), farm bunds and farm boundaries (for timber,
                    green leaf manure and protective functions), in block plantations (for fodder and poles) or as
                    interspersed trees in croplands (for fuel wood, edible products, fodder and timber). Yield and
                    biomass production of these species under different management scenarios in various agroforestry
                    practices, in the four southern states indicate that based on the management objective, direct
                    production functions of the trees as well as biomass productivity can be manipulated to the benefit
                    of the farmers. Silvicultural management like thinning has been fairly effective in block
                    plantations and wide-row intercropping for species like teak, eucalyptus, acacias, leucaena and
                    neem. Canopy and root management have been found to be particularly effective for short rotation
                    species like Casuarina equisetilifa in wide row intercropping in terms of overall biomass production

                    were analysed after classifying them into four cohorts, based on the radial growth accumulated over
                    the initial 20 years. Growth rates varied significantly among cohorts up to 15 years, but converged
                    towards the end of the juvenile phase of tree growth (16-20 years). Correlations show that growth up
                    to 15 years had a significant impact on the cumulative growth. Trees that accrued larger growth
                    during the initial 10 years, attained lesser growth during the period between 16-20 years and vice
                    versa, showing a clear growth rate compensation. Growth beyond 20 years was relatively constant
                    across the cohorts. It is also shown that competition affects trees that had slower growth initially
                    and has little influence on fat growing ones. The paper discusses the implications of the findings
                    in the management of teak trees.</p>

                  <p>Insect populations with discrete generation cycles (DGCs) have been rarely encountered in the
                    tropics. Among the few known species, spatially segregated costal populations of Opisina arenosella,
                    the coconut caterpillar, have been shown to follow DGCs during out breaks in Sri Lanka. Climatic
                    parameters are known to be important in regulating generation cycles in insect populations. But,
                    unlike temperate conditions, the tropics are characterized by high spatial heterogeneity in climate,
                    which prompted the present investigation on generation cycles of populations of O.arenosella
                    peninsula. Two spatially isolated populations were regularly sampled for two years and data were
                    subjected to time series analysis to determine periodicity, if any, in the occurrence of different
                    developmental stages of the population. Results showed that populations followed DGC with a
                    periodicity of approximately one generation, and further, correlations showed that there was a
                    definite lead/lag in the peaks of different developmental stages, which closely corresponded to the
                    developmental period of different stages of the insect. The findings suggest that discrete cycles of
                    O.arenosella may not be related to seasonality. The importance of generation cycles with respect to
                    pest management has also been discussed.</p>

                    comparable with those from other tropical parts of the world for species richness and diversity. In
                    general, arthropods from D.inducus were more diverse than those form V.indica. Coleoptera tended to
                    be more dominant and hence less diverse in canopies of both trees. The most diverse group in
                    D.indicus was Diptera, while Areneae was the most diverse group in V.indica canopy. The proportion
                    of singletons was extremely high for all the groups, often exceeding 75%. Our results suggest that
                    the arthropod composition of the most dominant tree species in the forest could significantly
